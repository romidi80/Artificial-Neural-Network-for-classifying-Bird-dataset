# Deep-neural-network-for-classifying-bird-Dataset-using-regularization-methods
Classifying birds dataset using neural network using different optimizers, activation functions.

In this project, our focus was on developing and optimizing a neural network model for effectively classifying a birds dataset. Our approach encompassed a comprehensive exploration of various model configurations, including distinct optimizers, neuron arrangements, and activation functions.

Our initial step was to enhance the training process by converting all images into grayscale versions, simplifying the subsequent steps. With this foundation, we proceeded to experiment with different optimizers, notably the Adam optimizer and the SGD optimizer with varying momentum values. For each model iteration, we meticulously reported metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and loss, aiming to identify the most promising model configuration.

A key component of our investigation involved the manipulation of activation functions. By incorporating variations like ReLU and softmax, we aimed to discern the impact of these functions on model performance. This iterative process enabled us to determine the activation function that yielded the most favorable outcomes.

Furthermore, we recognized the importance of regularization techniques. We explored models both with and without regularization methods, seeking to identify the differences in performance and robustness. This comparative analysis allowed us to gauge the effectiveness of incorporating regularization in our model architecture.

In our pursuit of refining model effectiveness, we also experimented with different epoch values and batch sizes. This experimentation served to uncover the impact of training duration and batch processing on the final results.

In summary, this project revolved around the optimization of a neural network model for classifying a birds dataset. The journey encompassed diverse aspects including grayscale conversion, optimizer comparison, activation function exploration, regularization assessment, and varied epoch and batch experimentation. The culmination of these efforts led to the identification of the most optimal neural network model configuration.
